# AI Powered Regulatory Compliance Checker for Contracts

## 📌 Overview

This project aims to build an AI-driven platform that automatically analyzes contracts and verifies their compliance against applicable laws, regulations, and policies. By leveraging Advanced Large Language Models (LLMs), LangChain frameworks, and regulatory data scrapers, the system helps businesses, legal teams, and compliance officers reduce manual effort, minimize risks, and ensure adherence to evolving regulations.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Integration Layer** – to connect with external systems (e.g., contract management tools, APIs, databases)  

## 🎯 Key Features (Planned / In-Progress)

- ✅ **Contract Ingestion** – upload or connect existing contract repositories  
- ✅ **Regulatory Knowledge Base** – continuously updated via scrapers  
- ✅ **Compliance Analysis** – detect non-compliance clauses and highlight risks  
- ✅ **Custom Rules Engine** – apply organization-specific compliance rules  
- ✅ **Explainable AI Reports** – summaries with risk scoring and recommendations  
- 🔄 **Integration APIs** – connect with ERP/CRM/legal platforms
